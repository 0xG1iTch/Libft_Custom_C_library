# LIB_FT

## 📚 Project Overview

**LIB_FT** is a foundational project developed at 42 School. The goal is to create a custom C library by re-implementing standard C functions and adding utility functions.
This project serves as an introduction to low-level programming, focusing on memory management, function implementation, and adherence to the C standard.

With **LIB_FT**, you’ll have a powerful toolkit to streamline future C projects while gaining a deeper understanding of how standard libraries work under the hood.

## 🛠️ Features

This library includes the following key components:

### 🔹 Standard Functions
Re-implementations of standard C library functions, such as:
- `ft_strlen` - Calculate the length of a string.
- `ft_strcpy` - Copy strings safely.
- `ft_atoi` - Convert strings to integers.
- `ft_memset` - Fill memory with a constant byte.

### 🔹 Utility Functions
Additional helper functions to expand the capabilities of your programs:
- String manipulation utilities.
- Memory management helpers.
- Conversion tools.

### 🔹 Bonus Functions (Achieved 25%)
Includes advanced functionalities, such as:
- Linked list manipulation functions (`ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd`, etc.).
- Enhanced modular tools for more complex use cases.
